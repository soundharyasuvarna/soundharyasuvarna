I hold a Masters Degree in Data Science at Santa Clara University - Leavey School of Business

I have 6+ years of experience in comprehending business challenges and addressing them through data analytics and machine learning methods. Additionally, I specialize in crafting dashboards that effectively communicate the insights gleaned from the data, illuminating its narrative.

Furthermore, I have a strong practical and theoretical experience in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI.

ðŸ”­ Below are some of the companies I have worked as a data scientist:

Centene Corporation

Intel Corporation

Vmware

Genpact

Accenture

ðŸ”­ I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Trees (DT)

Random Forests (RF)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Naive Bayes (NB)

Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)

XGBoost

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

ðŸ”­ Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects:

Auto-Regressive (AR) Model

Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model

Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model

Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model
